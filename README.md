# Dungeons & Dragons Game

---
This project attempts to imitate the game Dungeons & Dragons. By using a NumPy array, the game's primary board is an infinite board. Additionally, we have attempted to incorporate several game choices. Below is an example of an abstract board game.

In this version of the game, the following features have been added:
* You can either start a new game or continue from the last checkpoint.
* Your number of hints will vary depending on the game's three stages.
* By selecting the "Help" option, you may determine how near the dragon is and then flee.
Below is a screenshot of the game's menu.
